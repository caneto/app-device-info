A Flutter app to show how to work with nested tab navigation using go_router package

## Getting Started

Check out my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@antonio.tioypedro1234/flutter-go-router-the-essential-guide-349ef39ec5b3)

Run this command to add `go_router`: 
```
flutter pub add go_router
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml:
```
dependencies:
  go_router: ^7.1.1
```
